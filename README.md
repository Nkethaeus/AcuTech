# AcuTech

AcuTech is an innovative smartphone-based audio classification system designed for the identification and classification of acute coughs using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This groundbreaking system represents the culmination of our undergraduate thesis project, combining cutting-edge technology with the pursuit of scientific inquiry.

## Overview

AcuTech heralds a new era in healthcare technology by leveraging the power of CNNs to discern and classify acute coughs with unprecedented accuracy and efficiency. By harnessing the computational capabilities of smartphones, AcuTech empowers individuals and healthcare professionals alike to detect and monitor respiratory conditions with ease and precision.

## Features

- **CNN-based Classification**: Harnesses the capabilities of Convolutional Neural Networks to analyze audio samples and classify them based on the presence of acute coughs.
  
- **Real-time Analysis**: Provides instantaneous results, enabling prompt detection and assessment of respiratory symptoms without the need for specialized equipment.
  
- **User-friendly Interface**: Delivers a seamless user experience through an intuitive smartphone application, ensuring accessibility and ease of use for individuals of all technical proficiencies.
  
- **Data Privacy**: Prioritizes the security and privacy of user data, adhering to stringent protocols and regulations to safeguard sensitive health information.

## Technologies Used

- 
- Python for data processing and general implementation
- TensorFlow & Scikit-learn for building and implementing the CNN-RF and SVM models
- Anvil for web interface and hosting the web server
- HTML, CSS for frontend

## Results

After retraining and retesting the two models, significant improvements were observed in their performance. The CNN-RF model showed a notable increase in validation accuracy, rising from 38.05% to 63.23%. Additionally, the f-score for this model improved from 0.49 to 0.58. 

In comparison, the SVM model continued to demonstrate superior performance, achieving a validation accuracy of 87.50% and an f-score of 0.86. These results indicate the effectiveness of both models in audio length classification, with SVM showing particularly strong performance.

## Usage

To utilize AcuTech, simply download the smartphone application from the designated platform and follow the on-screen instructions to record and analyze audio samples. The application will then employ advanced CNN algorithms to classify the presence of acute coughs, providing valuable insights into respiratory health in real-time.
